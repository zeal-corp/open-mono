# Unit testing in beverly

## Overview
A crucial part of maintaining a component library is ensuring that components are reliable and consistently available. 
To that end, we have to design an automated testing system that can account for generalized client use cases. 
Since all of our components are redux based styled components we’ll be following the suggested 
[redux recommendation](https://redux.js.org/usage/writing-tests) of “[using] integration tests for everything working together” 
with unit tests reserved for “particularly complex reducers or selectors”. 

Despite beverly being our overarching component library, we actually offer 2 sub classes of components, 
simple stateless components (such as Buttons, Inputs, Tables) and more complex integrated components that are a 
composition of the former and will most likely access zeal related data. In order for the stateless components to 
function accurately they need to to work in a generic setting with arbitrary data, the integrated components on the 
other hand will communicate with other parts of the zeal infrastructure. Our tests are differentiated in order to reflect 
these two different use cases.

## Tech
For our basic components we want to ensure a level of functionality that can be covered by basic integration tests.
In that regard the following libraries will suffice:
1. Jest
1. react testing library
1. jest-fetch-mock
1. Jest-dom

Our complex integrated components will all be tested using weyoun to ensure access to other zeal services.

## Approach

When writing these tests there are a few questions we want to answer by the end of a test suite being run
1. Does the component render?
1. Does the component respond to state changes?
1. Does the component trigger callbacks?
1. Is the component customizable?
1. Optionally: does the component communicate appropriately with the rest of our services.

The goal with the small components should really be around the first four, each possible use case/state should be tested in an independent `test`.
